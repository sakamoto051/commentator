# Walkthrough - Creating Extension Icon for Commentator

Created a modern, high-quality icon for the Commentator extension and integrated it into the project.

## Changes Made

### Icons Created

The following icons were generated and resized for the extension:
- [icon16.png](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/client/dist/icons/icon16.png) (16x16)
- [icon48.png](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/client/dist/icons/icon48.png) (48x48)
- [icon128.png](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/client/dist/icons/icon128.png) (128x128)

Base image used:
![Commentator Icon Base](/home/sakamoto/.gemini/antigravity/brain/1f280d50-ab84-445d-9be4-d40b4dc7550e/commentator_icon_base_1771850576983.png)

### Configuration Updated

- [manifest.json](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/client/dist/manifest.json) was updated to include the `icons` field.

## Verification Results

- Verified that the `icons/` directory contains all three PNG files.
- Verified file dimensions using `file` command.
- Verified [manifest.json](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/client/dist/manifest.json) structure.
