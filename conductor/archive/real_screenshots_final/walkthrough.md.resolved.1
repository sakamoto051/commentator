# Walkthrough - Creating Extension Icon for Commentator

Created a modern, high-quality icon for the Commentator extension and integrated it into the project.

## Changes Made

### Icons Created

The following icons were generated and resized for the extension:
- [icon16.png](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/client/dist/icons/icon16.png) (16x16)
- [icon48.png](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/client/dist/icons/icon48.png) (48x48)
- [icon128.png](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/client/dist/icons/icon128.png) (128x128)

Base image used:

### Extension Package Created

- [commentator-extension.zip](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/commentator-extension.zip)
  - 内容: `client/dist` ディレクトリの全ファイル（manifest, icons, assets等）
  - 用途: ブラウザの拡張機能管理画面から読み込み、またはストアへのアップロード用

- Verified file dimensions using `file` command.
- Verified `manifest.json` structure.
