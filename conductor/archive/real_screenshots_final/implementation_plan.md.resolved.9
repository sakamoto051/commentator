# Implementation Plan - Privacy Policy & Compliance

Establish a clear Privacy Policy for "Commentator" and ensure it is accessible from both the landing page and within the extension to comply with Chrome Web Store's data protection requirements.

## Proposed Changes

### Documentation

#### [NEW] [lp/privacy.html](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/lp/privacy.html)
Create a dedicated Privacy Policy page that details:
- Data collected: Video ID, comment content, and playback timing.
- Purpose: To enable synchronized comment display.
- Data retention: Stored on our servers to provide the service.
- User rights: Transparency regarding data usage.

#### [MODIFY] [lp/index.html](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/lp/index.html)
Add a "Privacy Policy" link to the footer.

### Extension UI

#### [MODIFY] [client/src/main.tsx](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/client/src/main.tsx)
Add a link to the Privacy Policy within the extension's popup to satisfy the requirement that the policy must be accessible "in the extension itself".

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Verify that the `lp/privacy.html` page load correctly.
- Ensure the link in the popup opens the Privacy Policy page.
- Review the manifest and descriptions to ensure they align with the privacy disclosures.
