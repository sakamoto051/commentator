# Implementation Plan - Real YouTube Screenshots

Capture highly realistic screenshots of the "Commentator" extension in action by navigating to a real YouTube video and injecting the extension's UI components via Playwright.

## Proposed Changes

### Infrastructure

#### [NEW] [e2e/youtube_screenshot.spec.ts](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/e2e/youtube_screenshot.spec.ts)
Implement a Playwright script that:
- Navigates to a specific YouTube video.
- Injects Danmaku-style comments (flowing text) over the video player.
- Injects a realistic comment input box (mocking the extension UI).
- Captures a 1280x800 screenshot.

### Assets

#### [MODIFY] [client/public/service_screenshot.png](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/client/public/service_screenshot.png)
Replace the previous screenshot with this more realistic YouTube-based capture.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `npx playwright test e2e/youtube_screenshot.spec.ts` to generate the image.

### Manual Verification
- Review the generated `service_screenshot.png` to ensure it looks indistinguishable from real usage.
