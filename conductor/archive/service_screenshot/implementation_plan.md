# Implementation Plan - Direct Service Screenshot

Create a direct "screenshot style" image of the "Commentator" extension showing comments flowing over a video player, providing a clear view of the core feature.

## Proposed Changes

### Assets & Icons

#### [NEW] [service_screenshot.png](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/client/public/service_screenshot.png)
Generate a 1280x800 screenshot-style image showing the video player with multiple flowing comments.

### Configuration & Documentation

#### [MODIFY] [walkthrough.md](file:///home/sakamoto/.gemini/antigravity/brain/1f280d50-ab84-445d-9be4-d40b4dc7550e/walkthrough.md)
Update the walkthrough to include the new direct service screenshot.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Verify the `service_screenshot.png` clearly shows comments flowing over a video.
- Ensure the dimensions are exactly 1280x800.
- Check that the image is successfully synced across relevant directories.
