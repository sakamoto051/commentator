# Implementation Plan - Realistic Usage Mockup

Create a realistic "usage mockup" promotional banner for the "Commentator" extension to help users visualize its practical application.

Generate and add a new realistic mockup banner (1280x800) showing the extension in use on a laptop.

### Configuration & Documentation

#### [MODIFY] [walkthrough.md](file:///home/sakamoto/.gemini/antigravity/brain/1f280d50-ab84-445d-9be4-d40b4dc7550e/walkthrough.md)
Update the walkthrough to include the new realistic usage mockup.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Verify the `promo_mockup.png` displays a realistic browser scenario.
- Ensure the dimensions are exactly 1280x800.
- Check that the image is successfully synced across relevant directories.
