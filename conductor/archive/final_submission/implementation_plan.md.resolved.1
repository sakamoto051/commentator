# Implementation Plan - Refining Design (Subtle Style)

Refine the "Commentator" extension icons and promotional banner to have a cleaner, more professional, and less "AI-generated" look.

## Proposed Changes

### Assets & Icons

#### [MODIFY] [icon16.png](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/client/dist/icons/icon16.png), [icon48.png](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/client/dist/icons/icon48.png), [icon128.png](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/client/dist/icons/icon128.png)
Replace existing neon/3D icons with flat, professional vector-style icons.

#### [MODIFY] [promo_banner.png](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/client/public/promo_banner.png)
Replace the current heavy 3D banner with a clean, SaaS-style promotional image (1280x800).

### Packaging

#### [MODIFY] [commentator-extension.zip](file:///home/sakamoto/apps/commentator/commentator-extension.zip)
Regenerate the distribution package with the refined assets.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Verify the new icons (16, 48, 128) have a flat/minimalist style.
- Verify the promotional banner is exactly 1280x800 and has a professional layout.
- Check that all synced files (public and dist) are updated.
